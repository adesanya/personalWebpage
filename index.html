      <img class="AboutImg" src="/images/AboutOla.png" alt="">
      <p class="AboutText">I grew up in Lagos Nigeria and moved to the United States in 2012 to study Computer Science at the University of California Irvine. While pursuing my undergraduate degree I developed an interest in music but found it extremely difficult to learn. Determined I hired a music tutor “Fay Roberts” to teach me how to play the saxophone, Fay at the time used to teach music to the blind and I was fascinated about how they were able to learn. While taking classes with her, Fay applied the same techniques of tapping and moving ones fingers and hands to teach me how to play, and as she did this the idea of a haptic glove to help indicate what fingers to move in-order to play a musical note was born. With my technical background I was able to bring the haptic glove to life and became fascinated with wearable technologies ever since. After completing my undergraduate degree I joined Microsoft as a software engineer and continued to develop the glove project independently, in 2017 I filed for an international patent which later got published in July 2019. </p>

        <img class="projectImg"src="/images/keyboardGloveIcon.png" alt="">
        <p class="projectText">Haptic glove instructs wearer on what keys to play by vibrating the finger which corresponds to the musical note to be played. Over time user develops muscle memory and is able to play the song without help from the haptic glove.</p>

        <h2 class="projectLabel">Hand Tracking and Haptics</h2>
        <img class="projectImg"src="/images/HandTracking.png" alt="">
        <p class="projectText">With gyroscopes and accelerometers coupled with haptic actuators positioned around the palm, the glove allows you to bring your hands into the digital world while inversely communicating your digital interactions back to you through vibrations.</p>

        <h2 class="projectLabel" >AI Enabled Interactions</h2>
        <img class="projectImg"src="/images/AiInteractions.png" alt="">
        <p class="projectText">Glove uses a camera to recognize object a user is pointing to using pre trained AI/ML models and allows user to control the device using hand gestures, examples include pointing to a printer to send a document to be printed or pointing to a fan to turn it on.</p>

        <h2 class="projectLabel">Palm Vision (Accessibility)</h2>
        <img class="projectImg"src="/images/PalmVision.png" alt="">
        <p class="projectText">Glove uses camera and depth sensor to gather information on objects and obstacles in front of users path and converts the data gathered to vibrations for proximity from obstacles and audio feedback for identification of objects.</p>

      <h1 style="color: black;margin-left: 4%;padding-top: 15px;"">Patent</h1>
      <p id="patentText">Wearable computing apparatus for augmented reality, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence interactions, and systems and methods relating thereto. Generally, a wearable computing apparatus is provided, wherein the apparatus can be worn on a user’s hand and comprises a first subassembly including one or more processors, non-transitory memory for storing instructions, at least one haptic motor, and a first set of sensors adapted to sense positional characteristics of the user’s hand. In some embodiments, a second subassembly configured to couple with the first subassembly is provided. The second subassembly can include a plurality of flexible leads adapted to attach to the user’s fingers, and wherein each flexible lead includes a haptic motor and a second set of sensors adapted to sense a plurality of positional characteristics associated with each of the user’s fingers.</p>
